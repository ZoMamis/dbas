API
===

To use D-BAS' argumentation backend, we have developed an API to access it.
Authentication and argumentation steps can be performed via this API as it is
also possible in D-BAS.

APIv1 provides everything you need to remotely do the steps in an argumentation,
whilst APIv2 concentrates on a cleaner way to access data from D-BAS and also
provides a GraphQL entrypoint.

This API uses OpenAPI and is described in `/dbas_openapi_v3.yaml`. You can interactivly explore the API under `/swagger-ui`.
