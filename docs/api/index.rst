API
===

To use D-BAS' argumentation backend, we have developed an API to access it.
Authentication and argumentation steps can be performed via this API as it is
also possible in D-BAS.

APIv1 provides everything you need to remotely do the steps in an argumentation,
whilst APIv2 concentrates on a cleaner way to access data from D-BAS and also
provides a GraphQL entrypoint.

This API uses OpenAPI and is described `in this specification
<https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/MrOerni/D-BAS/1>`_, which is currently a
work-in-progress.
