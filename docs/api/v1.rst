APIv1
=====

This is the description for APIv1. We are currently working on a new APIv2,
which has GraphQL support and returns just that, what you have really queried.

APIv1 is primarily designed to call the same functions, which D-BAS itself calls
in the frontend, but just get a JSON-representation of it as a response.

The primary goal of APIv1 is to make the functionality as a dialog-game
execution platform of D-BAS accessible via a REST-API. We achieved this in
substituting ``/discuss/`` from the URL to a ``/api/``. For example: We could
access https://dbas.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/discuss/town-has-to-cut-spending ,
replace "discuss" with "api" and get the api-route for the very same step in the
discussion, just as a JSON representation:
https://dbas.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/api/town-has-to-cut-spending

To query data without needing to add new routes APIv2 intended to be.

All steps in the discussion are accessible via the APIv1. You could just ignore
the other data, which is sent from D-BAS and use the data you actually want.
Additionally, there is an authentication-mechanism, which is described in more
detail, because this is a new / unique feature of the API, which is not used in
the frontend.

This API uses OpenAPI and is described in `/swagger-ui/dbas_openapi_v3.yaml </swagger-ui/dbas_openapi_v3.yaml>`_. You can interactivly explore the API under `/swagger-ui/ </swagger-ui/>`_.


Authentication
==============

Login
-----

There is only one important route for authentication: ``/api/login``. This route
requires a JSON-encoded body containing the keys "nickname" and "password". Post
these credentials to this endpoint and you get a JSON-response containing the
token used for authentication in the next steps.

The token is returned as a JSON-web-token ( https://jwt.io/ ).
The token is signed and can be verified using the public key at: ``/api/pubkey``
We use ECDSA signature algorithm using SHA-256 hash algorithm.

Beside the token, the ``nickname`` and the ``id`` are contained in the JSON response, for legacy reasons.
These two properties are also encoded in the token itself.

An example in Clojure with clj-http looks like this::

  (client/post "https://dbas.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/api/login"
               {:content-type :json
                :form-params {:nickname "Walter"
                              :password "iamatestuser2016"}})

The response could then look like this (here in EDN-format)::

  {:request-time 111,
   :repeatable? false,
   :protocol-version {:name "HTTP", :major 1, :minor 1},
   :streaming? true,
   :chunked? false,
   :cookies
   {"dbas_prototyp"
    {:discard true,
     :path "/",
     :secure false,
     :value "f983ca3e934b2de323523d2f25d89e280b7c7442a6bec923feea472cb54c8d92104c030f",
     :version 0}},
   :reason-phrase "OK",
   :headers
   {"Connection" "close",
    "Content-Length" "200",
    "Content-Type" "application/json",
    "Date" "Wed, 13 Sep 2017 08:41:34 GMT",
    "Server" "waitress",
    "X-Content-Type-Options" "nosniff"},
   :orig-content-encoding nil,
   :status 200,
   :length 200,
   :body
   "{\"nickname\": \"Walter\", \"id\": 42, \"token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJbhGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9.eyJuaWNrbmFtZSI6IkNocmlzdGlhbiIsImlkIjozfQ.VWsWZ8vNTwe0rlYcr9kgI9ZjlUBnBZRJm3flXtOKzLR4lMLxVhhoe89ufu04UFfLhksFu7IMj9qGqIzZhhblaA\"}"}

This token can then be parsed and used in your project::

  (def token (->
              (client/post "https://dbas.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/api/login"
                           {:content-type :json
                            :form-params {:nickname "Walter"
                                          :password "iamatestuser2016"}})
              :body
              (json/read-str :key-fn keyword)
              :token))

Authenticate
------------

We use the Bearer authentication schema like described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-6.1.1

For example::

  (client/get "https://dbas.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/api/"
              {:headers {"Authorization" (str "Bearer " token})}})


Authentication Types
--------------------

The authentication-types require their own defined keys in the header. See this
table for the required and optional keys:

+------------------------+----------------------+---------------+---------------+
| Authentication type    | Description          | required keys | optional keys |
+========================+======================+===============+===============+
| user                   | Authenticate a user  | ``token``     | none          |
|                        | against D-BAS        |               |               |
