Deployment
==========
The general deployment is described in :doc:`../docker/index`. If you are interested in details, please have a look and  http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_cookbook/en/latest/deployment/nginx.html.

Unfortunately some URLs are hardcoded in our project, therefore you have to frep for *dbas.cs* replace it with the your address,
