D-BAS is based on [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and shipped via [Dockers](https://www.docker.com/). It is a novel approach to online
argumentation. It avoids the pitfalls of  unstructured systems such as asynchronous threaded discussions and it is
usable by any participant without training while still supporting the full complexity  of real-world argumentation.
The key idea is to let users exchange arguments  with each other in the form of a time-shifted dialog where arguments
are presented and acted upon one-at-a-time.


## Setup for Linux
