# D-BAS

D-BAS is a novel approach to online argumentation. It avoids the pitfalls of 
unstructured systems such as asynchronous threaded discus sions and it is usable 
by any participant without training while still supporting the full complexity 
of real-world argumentation. The key idea is to let users exchange arguments 
with each other in the form of a time-shifted dialog where arguments are presented 
and acted upon one-at-a-time.
