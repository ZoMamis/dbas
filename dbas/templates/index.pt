									<li> Participants are able to add and modify positions and arguments in every discussion.

										<ul class="lead list">
											<li> Guided Discussion: The participants will be lead through the discussion .</li>
											<li> Island View: A position with all connected arguments is presented as island. This supports the insight of a discussion about a specific position.</li>
											<li> Expert View: Participants are able to see and do everything.</li>

									<h3>Pro-Contra Lists</h3>

								</div>
								<div class="col-md-4 col-badge">

									<h3>Forum</h3>
									<p>Forum-based approaches are well known to all kind of users, but are only scale with the number of users, not with the number of arguments. Therefore messages can be highly redundant. Additionally the messages are not connected logically to each other.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-md-4 col-badge">

									<h3>Argumentation-based Approaches</h3>
									<p>This concept seems to be perfect, because posts are connected logically to each other and redundancy can be avoided. Unfortunately these tools are for experts only and not for amateurs.</p>
